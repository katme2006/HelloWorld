Hello World! 

My cat wants me to stop coding and pet him.

He is yelling at me.

I love Ernie.

Ernest is my cat and his name in Spanish is Ernesto, so that's what I call him when I'm doing Duolingo.

Ernest likes dogs but hates cats. 

He is bad at math but I don't tell him this because it's rude.

Ernie's favorite food is gross can mush in a can. And also greek yogurt.
