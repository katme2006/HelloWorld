A Haiku about Chipotle



And now a rap about Chipotle made by Chat GPT 4

(Verse 1)
Yo, it's lunchtime, let's head to Chipotle,
Where the flavor's so bold, it'll make you say "Ol√©!"
Grab a burrito, fill it up with pride,
Salsa on the side, we're taking this ride.

(Chorus)
Chipotle, oh Chipotle, you're the one for me,
Rice, beans, and guac, oh so tasty and free,
Corn on the cob, that's the way it should be,
Corny rap about Chipotle, can't you see?

(Verse 2)
Guacamole's fresh, like a green machine,
Sour cream on top, that's a dreamy scene,
Cilantro and lime, add some zest and spice,
In Chipotle's world, everything's so nice.

(Chorus)
Chipotle, oh Chipotle, you're the one for me,
Rice, beans, and guac, oh so tasty and free,
Corn on the cob, that's the way it should be,
Corny rap about Chipotle, can't you see?
